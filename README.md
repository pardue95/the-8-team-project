# Drinks N' Dice: Board Game & Cocktail Randomizer

1. Elevator Pitch:
 

 “Life is like a board game. Advancing forward is the key.” 
― Torron-Lee Dewar

Drinks N’ Dice is a randomizer that will help groups of friends and families decide what they want to play on a given evening in together, as well as spice things up with a perfect cocktail. Who doesn’t love to have a game night in surrounded by loved ones and laughs...and the occasional spirit? 

Drinks N’ Dice takes the guesswork out of “What will we play?” or “What do we need to make?” This site can do both for you and have you playing, laughing, and having a great time in a matter of moments. 

Here’s how it works: you simply key us into a few details for gameplay, such as minimum age, number of players, price point, time allotted and “Roll the Dice”. Boom. You have a random board game suggested for you and your group.

A cocktail will be randomly paired for you on the site. Don’t like it? Click the button to see a new one!
